AppleMusicFest

This project was started to mimic instafest (https://www.instafest.app/home) which at the time this project began did not support Apple Music. The idea is to create a web interface for Apple Music users to get a festival lineup poster based on their most listened to artists of the year, determined by their Apple Music Replay playlist for that year. This is what instafest presently provides to Spotify users.
